# Oh my god these two last ones are so scuffed
# Ok, let me try and explain these two countryToYearToOffenseDataDictionary things.
# They should really be their own classes but I'm lazy and this code will get used by literally only me so we don't exactly need readability for modification
# The structure is as follows:
# country name will be mapped to a dictionary 
# that dictionary in turn maps years to an array that holds their data in [total points earned/conceded, #games]
# This is objectively horrible btw and should not be replicated. Do as I say, not as I do.

# We need information from 5 years in the past so the first 5 years are used as startup data but omitted
